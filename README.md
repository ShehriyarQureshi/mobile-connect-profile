**My internship has been completed. I won't be developing this project further but will still accept contributions if any.**

**Feel free to fork this and work on it. I did develop it to at least have a base to build upon.**

# GSMA Mobile Connect Profile Implementation

This is part of my internship work at Ufone. It aims to directly be used or serve as a blueprint for implementing Mobile Connect.

I've selected the MIT license so that Operator specific implementation can be used without having to open source the operator's middleware integration code.

## What it aims to be

I've written a blog about how I think GSMA Mobile Connect should be implemented.

This project aims to follow that architecture design.

## Installation Steps

You'll have to build the project using **Maven** and deploy the endpoints on Tomcat.
